## Notes and Considerations

### minimally clamped epochs

Depending on the protocol needs, epochs could be clamped even more, should we assume logical behaviors or nah ?
Such that what's the point of setting rewards that are 1000 epochs away from the current one ? 
Should we always go for minimal viable clamping(MVC) ? Edge cases are hidden in unlogical behaviors.
